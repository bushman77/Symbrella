defmodule Core.MWE.Signatures do
  @moduledoc """
  Sliding-window MWE detector that emits symbolic intent bias.

  • Pure, struct-safe (uses Map.get/update, no Access).
  • Two stages:
      - :early — light lexical rules only (no DB dependence)
      - :late  — lexical OR POS-pattern matches (uses `si.active_cells` if present)
  • Returns SI with:
      - `:intent_bias` :: %{token_index(integer) => float}
      - `:mwe_matches`  :: [%{span: {i,j}, size: 2..5, phrase: binary, pos: [binary], kind: :lex | :pos | :both}]
      - `:trace` updated with {:mwe_signatures, %{stage: stage, accepted: n}}

  Options:
    * `stage: :early | :late` (default :late)
    * `extra_lex: [binary]` — additional lexical MWEs (normalized)
    * `multiplier: float`   — global bias scaler (default 1.0)
    * `demote_funcs?: boolean` — demote isolated function-word unigrams (default true)
